# Text-Quest

A text-based adventure game I made for fun during my Spring semester of 2022. The primary purpose for making this project was to develop my skills in Java UI development.

Not all original images and sounds are mine, but most were modified extensively for use in this project. Photoshop files(.psd) are in the resources folder for those interested.

Runnable jar file for the completed version of the game can be found in the out/artifacts directory (requires Java to be on your computer, however).
